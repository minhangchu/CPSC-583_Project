<h2> Project Hand-in 3 </h2>

<p> This is submission for Project Hand-in 3. General design direction is a circular dendrogram. I found my data contains elements: continents, countries, and companies, which can be represented as a tree structure. My variations explore colors, size of bubbles, and structures to see different aspects work for my designs. I used different colors to encode operation dominants (types of business) and the size of bubbles to show the revenues of each business, while other information are represented as a tree. Moving forward, user will see more information when hovering mouse over the bubbles.</p>
<p> Please click these buttons to see variations of the designs! Thanks </p>
